            <p>I am a current student at Brigham Young University in Idaho through their online Pathway Worldwide program.  I am majoring in Web Design and Development.  I previously worked as a Medical Transcriptionist until it became clear that the industry was changing and some states were passing laws against subcontractors such as an MT.  I have a passion for computers and in my studies have found frontend web design and development to be my career choice moving forward.</p>
